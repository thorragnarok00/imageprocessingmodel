# Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

## Activity Part 1 Image Processing in Mobile Development 2

This project demonstrates image processing, model training, and classification/prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of images to classify them into two categories using a console-based Python program.
